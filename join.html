<h2>Visitors/Exchanges</h2>

I am honored to host visitors in my group. In my experience, both the host and visitor are most productive if the terms and the program of the said research visit are discussed and planned ahead of time. Please email me at  <a href="mailto:ydvorki1@jhu.edu">ydvorki1@jhu.edu</a>  so we can discuss the matter.

	
<h2>Postdocs, Ph.D. and M.Sc. students</h2>

	<p> I am constantly seeking to recruit early career talents that can work with me on a broad variety of problems.  </p>
	
	<p></p>I tend to work best with students and postdocs with a strong mathematical background who are interested in interdisciplinary work. </p>
	
	<p>If you would like to send me an email about your application, please include your CV and transcripts, as well as a brief description of any past research experience. Prior to applying, prospective candidates are expected to review my recent publications  and have training in electrical engineering (preferred concentrations are power engineering, control, networking) or in a related field (applied math, systems engineering, operations research, industrial/mechanical engineering, computer science, etc).  Please email me at <a href="mailto:ydvorki1@jhu.edu">ydvorki1@jhu.edu</a>  so we can discuss the matter. </p> 

	<p>I expect that prospective postdocs have gained professional maturity to understand what is required from their applications and, therefore, further guidance is only applicable to Ph.D. applicants.  </p>
	<p> Trading off <i>prior academic/research accomplishments</i> <u>and</u> <i>future research potential</i>, I aim to identify candidates who have demonstrated  <i>academic</i> <u>or</u> <i>research</i> achievements, commeasurable with their educaitonal and career level,  and also show promise for personal growth as researchers and for making impactful contributions. There is no "golden" rule to predict future performance, especially in a quickly changing research field, and/or guarantee admission. However, in Ph.D. applications,  often even before reading your CV, I typically look at:

	<ul>
	<li><b>GPA and transcripts</b>: I always review the list of courses taken by applicants. Having an A- in convex optimization is more important and revealing than having A+ in Russian Litearture (no offense, Dostoevsky!).</li>
	<li><b>Research statement</b>: This document must demonstrate (i) maturity of thought in a research area, which  could be but is not neccesarily energy-related and connects to engineering or computational methods (see above, applicants from related fields are welcome), and (ii) interest in tackiling energy-related problems. </li>
	<li><b>Research/work experience</b>: Prior research/work experience, especially in the field or closely related areas, is highly valued. This can be through research internships, undergraduate or M.Sc. research projects/thesis, participation in research publications,  full-time employment after your terminal degree, etc (you can literally make your own case here and it is not required or exepcted to hit all the factors I listed). Pursuing a Ph.D. is not solely about studying; it also involves significant research work, creativity, and the ability to contribute original knowledge to the academic community within the chosen field of study and, hence, it is important to show the ability to "get the job done" and "push the final product out".  </li>
	<li><b>Letters of Recommendation</b>: Strong letters of recommendation from faculty members or researchers who can attest to the applicant's research abilities, work ethic, and potential for success in a PhD program are crucial. I tend to put a higher weight on letters from people (in the US and glboally) whom I know personally.  </li> 
	<li><b>English Proficiency</b>: Strong command of the English language, including excellent written and verbal communication skills, is essential for successful participation in academic discussions, coursework, research collaborations, and effective presentation of research findings, which effectively define one's impact. This requirement also applies to native speakers who some times may confuse fluency for mastery. TOEFL is a metric that I take into account for non-native speakers, but I also carry out live interviews and rarely make decisions exclusively based on TOEFL scores.  </li>
	</ul>	 </p>
	
	<p>One of the <b>key aspects</b> of my evaluaiton, based on all documents submitted with an application, is to understand the level of and potential for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_maturity"></b>mathematical maturity</a>, an irreplacible ingredient for success. </p>
	<p>While there are many things that I take into account while evaluating applicants for admission and I could not possibly  list them all, there are a few things that I rarely take into account: GRE scores (if you meet a reasonable threshold), <i>number</i> of  papers published (I prefer one quality paper over a few boring ones), and <i>number</i> of citations/h-index.  </p>
	<p> If interested, please apply to either ECE or CaSE departments. Prior to submission, please review <b>application requirements/deadlines</b> here:
	<ul>
  	<li>ECE: <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/ece-admissions/graduate-admission-info/">https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/ece-admissions/graduate-admission-info/</a></li>
  	<li>CaSE: <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/case/admissions/">https://engineering.jhu.edu/case/admissions/</a></li>
</ul>	 </p>
	<p>A special note for applicants from <b>Iran</b>, <b>Russia</b>, <b>Venezuela</b> and other so-called "sensitive" countries: I will review your applications using the same criteria as for  applications from other countries; however, for the sake of transparency, I would like to remind you  that visa application process is, unfortunately and ultimately, beyond my control. While I will do my best to support and facilitate the visa process for admitted candidates, there is very little that I can do. Regrettably,  I also cannot guarantee or even estimate the likelihood of visa approvals, as the decision lies with the respective immigration authorities. </b></p>
	<p>Please note that I receive a realtively large number of requests so please be patient and, if you do not hear from me within a month, you should try next year.</p>


	<h2>About Baltimore and Hopkins</h2>

	
<p>Baltimore is a vibrant tapestry of history, innovation, and diversity. As a student here, you'll find yourself immersed in a dynamic urban environment that seamlessly blends tradition with modernity. Baltimore offers a unique and enriching experience that will shape both your education and your life and boasts a myriad of academic and professional prospects, with renowned energy companies at your doorstep or  with a short commute to DC (e.g., BGE, Exelon, Constellation, etc; the big four  energy guys — Deloitte, KPMG, PwC, and EY; countless  government and private research  centers - APL, NIST, NETL, RAND, etc; and international organizations — World Bank, IEA, etc). </p>

<p> As a foodie, I appreciate  culinary adventures that  Baltimore offers, where every corner reveals a tantalizing array of flavors to satisfy even the most discerning  taste. There are more than 300+
local restaurants and eateries to choose from, and it is on my bucket list to visit them all (though, as of Aug 2023, I have visited only about 10).</p>

<p>Hopkins and its Homewood campus connect to Baltimore’s neighborhoods of Charles Village and Hampden (home to the famous holiday lights on 34th Street and the colorful, quirky Honfest); Mount Vernon and Station North,  and are a short bike or bus ride from vibrant neighborhoods of Fells Point, Canton, and Federal Hill. At Hopkins, your safety is our top priority, with <a href="https://publicsafety.jhu.edu/">comprehensive measures</a> in place to ensure a secure and supportive environment for all members of our community.</p>

<p> Hopkins students receive competetive compensation, benefits and support. In addition to a vibrant and safe environemnt, they also enjoy much lower costs of living, as compared to Bay area, Boston, DC, New York City, San Diego, Seattle, etc.  You can compare cost of living standards in Baltimore and other cities <a href="https://www.salary.com/tools/cost-of-living-calculator/baltimore-md-compare-cities">here</a>.	</p>
