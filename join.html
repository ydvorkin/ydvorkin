<h2>Visitors/Exchanges</h2>

I am honored to host visitors in my group. In my experience, both the host and visitor are most productive if the terms and the program of the research visit are discussed ahead of time. Please email me at  ydvorki1@jhu.edu  so we can discuss the matter.

	
<h2>Postdocs, Ph.D. and M.Sc. students</h2>

<p> I am constantly seeking to recruit early career talents that can work with me on a broad variety of problems.  I tend to work best with students and postdocs with a strong mathematical background who are interested in interdisciplinary work. If you would like to send me an email about your application, please include your CV and transcripts, as well as a brief description of any past research experience. Prior to applying, prospective candidates are expected to review my recent publications  and have training in electrical engineering (preferred concentrations are power engineering, control, networking) or in a related field (applied math, systems engineering, operations research, industrial/mechanical engineering, computer science, etc).  Please email me at <a href="mailto:ydvorki1@jhu.edu">ydvorki1@jhu.edu</a>  so we can discuss the matter. </p> 

	<p>I expect that prospective postdocs have gained professional maturity to udnerstand what is required from their applications and, therefore, further guidance is only applicable to Ph.D. applicants.  </p>
	<p> Trading off prior research accomplishments and future potential, I aim to identify candidates who have demonstrated  academic or research achievements, commeasurable with their educaitonal level,  and also show promise for personal growth as researchers and for making impactful contributions. There is no "golden" rule to guarantee admission. However, in applications,  often even before reading your CV, I typically look at:

	<ul>
	<li><b>GPA and transcripts</b>: I always review the list of course taken by applicants. Having an A- in convex optimization is more important than having A+ in Russian Litearture (no offense, Dostoevsky!).</li>
	<li><b>Research statement</b>: This document must demonstrate (i) maturity of thought in a research area, which  could be but not neccesarily energy-related and connects to engineering or computational methods (see above, applicants from related fields are welcome), and (ii) interest in tackiling energy-related problems. </li>
	<li><b>Research/work experience</b>: Prior research/work experience, especially in the field or closely related areas, is highly valued. This can be through research internships, undergraduate or M.Sc. research projects/thesis, participation in research publications,  full-time employment after your temrinal degree, etc. Pursuing a Ph.D. is not solely about studying; it also involves significant research work, creativity, and the ability to contribute original knowledge to the academic community within the chosen field of study and, hence, it is important to show the ability to "get the job done" and "push the final product out".  </li>
	<li><b>Letters of Recommendation</b>: Strong letters of recommendation from faculty members or researchers who can attest to the applicant's research abilities, work ethic, and potential for success in a PhD program are crucial. I tend to put a higher weight on letters from people (in the US and glboally) whom I know personally.  </li> 
	<li><b>English Proficiency</b>: Strong command of the English language, including excellent written and verbal communication skills, is essential for successful participation in academic discussions, coursework, research collaborations, and effective presentation of research findings. This requirement also applies to native speakers who some times may confuse fluency for mastery. TOEFL is a metric that I take into account for non-native speakers, but I also carry out live interviews and rarely make decisions exclusively based on TOEFL scores.  </li>
	</ul>	 </p>
	
	<p>One of the key aspect of my evaluaiton, based on all documents submitted with an application, is to understand the level of and potential for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_maturity"></b>mathematical maturity</a>, an irreplacible ingredient for success. </p>
	<p>While there are many things that I take into account while evaluating applicants for admission and I could not possibly  list them all, there are a few things that I rarely take into account: GRE scores (if you meet a reasonable threshold), <i>number</i> of  papers published (I prefer one quality paper over a few boring ones), and <i>number</i> of citations/h-index.  </p>
	<p> If interested, please apply to either ECE or CaSE departments. Prior to submission, please review application requirements/deadlines here:
	<ul>
  	<li>ECE: <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/ece-admissions/graduate-admission-info/">https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/ece-admissions/graduate-admission-info/</a></li>
  	<li>CaSE: <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/case/admissions/">https://engineering.jhu.edu/case/admissions/</a></li>
</ul>	 </p>
	<p>Please note that I receive a realtively large number of requests so please be patient and, if you do not hear from me within a month, you should try next year.</p>
